<p>I haven't detected a great deal of enthusiasm for this idea, and I can see it causing some confusion, partly because Unicode offers such a wide choice of symbols some of which are visually very similar.</p>
<p>I propose retaining a much smaller set of these symbols:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"÷" (xF7) for "div" because the symbol is widely recognised and "div" here is pretty ugly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"≺" (x227A) and "≻" (x227B) as alternatives to "&lt;" and "&gt;" in all operator symbols (other than XML markup contexts) that use these characters: for readability in contexts, especially XSLT, where the "&lt;" and "&gt;" characters need to be escaped</p>
</li>

<p>The idea is to define 3 parsing strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>numeric</code> -- number-like systems such as decimal;</li>
<li><code>alphabetic</code> -- alphabetical-like systems such as spreadsheet columns (A, B, ..., Z, AA, AB, ...)</li>
<li><code>additive</code> -- systems like roman and hebrew where the symbol represents a fixed value that is added together</li>
</ol>
<p>Parsing these, we have 3 properties:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>system as enum("numeric", "alphabetic", "additive") := "numeric"</code> -- which of the parsing strategies (number systems) to use;</li>
<li><code>symbols as xs:string := "0123456789"</code> -- the list of characters used to represent a digit;</li>
<li><code>additive-symbols as map(xs:integer, xs:string) := map {}</code> -- a map of the symbols in an additive system with the corresponding value of that symbol.</li>
</ol>
<p>Consideration 1 -- Should these also allow any whitespace and optional "+"/"-" symbols like the radix-based parse-integer?</p>
<p>Consideration 2 -- Should we define decimal format options for these, so the decimal format name can format/represent other number systems (binary, hex, hebrew, tamil, roman numerals, etc.). -- Note: this would make <code>system</code>, <code>symbols</code>, and <code>additive-symbols</code> properties of the decimal format object with the above defaults. The formatting would work in the same way as it is defined in the CSS Counter Styles specification.</p>
<h2>Design 1 -- Separate functions</h2>
<pre><code>fn:parse-numeric-integer($value as xs:string,
                         $symbols as xs:string := "0123456789") as xs:integer

fn:parse-alphabetic-integer($value as xs:string,
                            $symbols as xs:string := "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ") as xs:integer

fn:parse-additive-integer($value as xs:string,
                          $additive-symbols as map(xs:integer, xs:string)) as xs:integer
</code></pre>
<h2>Design 2 -- Combined functions</h2>
<pre><code>fn:parse-integer($value as xs:string,
                 $system as xs:string := "numeric",
                 $symbols as xs:string := "0123456789",
                 $additive-symbols as map(xs:integer, xs:string) := map {}) as xs:integer

<p>I suggest we schedule this PR for discussion since we have not previously discussed it.</p>
<p>One question for the group is what the name of the function should be (including the choice of namespace).</p>
<p>Another is whether the polarity of the callback function should be changed (from <code>break-when</code> to <code>continue-when</code> or similar).</p>
<p>We could also consider returning an array of sequences rather than a sequence of arrays. (But in my view sequences of arrays are rather easier to manage at the moment.)</p>

<p>This is currently possible only if the schemas are compatible (that is, if the union of the schemas is itself a valid schema). And even where it is possible, validation against the union of S1 and S2 may produce a different outcome from validation against S2, for example because a strict wildcard allows content that S2 would not allow. Substitution groups are a particular problem: if v1 and v2 have elements with different substitution group membership, then validating against the union of v1 and v2 allows the union of the substitution groups, which means that you haven't actually verified that the result document is valid against v2.</p>
<p>The problem is confounded by considerations that are outside the scope of the spec. What happens when you run two different stylesheets against the same source document? If the source document has been validated against S1, this means that both stylesheets must use schemas that are supersets of S1. The way this requirement is managed in Saxon is to introduce the concept of a Configuration in which transformations run; a Configuration has a single schema, and all source documents and stylesheets within the Configuration must use compatible subsets of this schema. A source document validated using one Configuration cannot be used in a different Configuration, because the type annotations would be meaningless against a different schema.</p>
<p>My proposal is to introduce the idea of a named schema (that is, a named collection of schema components). When we do <code>xsl:import-schema</code>, we can give the imported schema a name, and there is no requirement that the components in this schema should be compatible with the components in any other schema. When we refer to a schema type (for example in <code>$s cast as QName</code>) we should be able to qualify the type name with a schema name (we can postpone discussions of syntax, let's say <code>cast as my:part-number§v1</code> for now). When we request validation, we should be able to nominate the schema to be used for validation, for example <code>&lt;xsl:element name="e" validation="strict" schema="v2"&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The trickiest part is handling source documents, mainly because validation of source documents (especially those read using doc() or collection()) is at present almost entirely implementation-defined. I believe that we need explicit options to request validation of source documents against a specific schema. There should also be an option to validate a document against the schema identified in its own <code>xsi:schemaLocation</code>, in which case there should be no requirement that that schema is compatible with any schema known statically to the stylesheet.</p>
