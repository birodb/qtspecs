<p>Hi @michaelhkay . I took a slightly different approach. For unknown reasons long since lost in the mists of time the 'etc' files that act as databases for cross-spec references stored <code>nt</code> elements. That's weird because the <code>nt</code> elements are supposed to point to <code>prod</code> elements. I expect someone (let's be candid, probably me) got confused by the fact that <code>nt</code> elements have a <code>def</code> attribute and thought they were definitions. They're not. I've changed things so that the <code>prod</code> elements are now stored in the database. There's only going to ever be one of those.</p>
<p>I had to tidy up a few things to make that work, and we can't abandon support for <code>nt</code> files in 'etc' documents because we have existing files that don't get regenerated.</p>
<p>I also cleaned up the cross-reference error to <code>StringLiteral</code> in the XSLT spec and patched over a problem with a few link in the XQuery specifications.</p>
<p>There's no useful information from PR formatting of PRs that change the stylesheets, so I'm just going to cross my fingers and merge this. Please pull the latest and let me know if you see any problems!</p>

On the other hand XPath is very useful to us as the centerpiece of XSLT, XQuery</p>
<p>In order to allow people to have a more expanded use of XPath without to have to get the whole XSLT, XQuery story, it is perhaps the time to consider adding a thin layer of spec in order to have</p>
<ol>
<li>XPath</li>
<li>Some typing definition mechanism</li>
<li>Some function definition mechanism</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea is also to better integrate this with all Validation technologies (XSD, Relax NG, NVDL, JSONSchema, etc.) and allow EXPath, EXQuery and other to have a standard way to use all this around</p>
<p>We also want people that want to use only XPath (for example in LinQ or inside SQL) to have a broader capacity to interact with XML (instead of being limited to XPath 1.0 with namespaces)</p>
<p>I will try to add more and more precision to this proposal along the line, but I feel it is good enough to be a first stone to break and allow people to help drive this initiative</p>
<p>For the moment the name of this new beast is <strong>XPathWithCustomizableTypesAndFunctions</strong> in our proposal call XPath Next https://github.com/XPath-Next/XPath-Next/blob/first-draft/spec.md</p>
