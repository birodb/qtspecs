<blockquote>
<p>If the item-separator serialization parameter is absent, then for each subsequence of adjacent strings in S2, copy a single string to the new sequence equal to the values of the strings in the subsequence concatenated in order, each separated by a single space. Copy all other items to the new sequence. Otherwise, copy each item in S2 to the new sequence, inserting between each pair of items a string whose value is equal to the value of the item-separator parameter. The new sequence is S3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As written ("If...then.... Otherwise...."), this implies that the process whereby a block of adjacent strings are joined into a single string is performed only when the item separator parameter is absent. I.e., if the item-separator parameter is not absent, it will not be used to string-join adjacent groups of strings. Perhaps that is as intended, but I want to make sure.</p>
<p>Also, as written, this implies that when the parameter is absent, the sequence begins by finding all subsequences of adjacent strings, performing concatenation. Then all non-strings are added to the sequence. That seems wrong, because it appears to advise the processor to rearrange the sequence of input items.</p>
<p>I propose a revision along these lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Copy each item in S2 to a new sequence. If a given pair of adjacent items are both strings, then separate them with a string whose value is equal to the value of the item-separator parameter or is a single space if the item-separator parameter is absent. If a given pair of adjacent items are not both strings, insert between each pair of items a string whose value is equal to the value of the item-separator parameter. Once this is finished, take each adjacent group of strings and concatenate them into a single string. The new sequence is S3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My revision is based upon what I imagine happens, but implementers will know better than I.</p>
<p>I am working on some editorial touch-ups of the Serialization specifications, and can incorporate comments/suggestions made in this thread in that larger enterprise.</p>

<p>These aren't particularly convenient to use, for example getting multiple components of a duration is clumsy; and there are gaps, for example there are no functions to extract the parts of a <code>gMonthDay</code>.</p>
<p>I propose a general-purpose function <code>fn:parts()</code> which turns any of these composite atomic values into a map, enabling you to replace a call on <code>get-month-from-dateTime($value)</code> with <code>parts($value)?month</code>.</p>
<p>So far this dupllicates existing functionality perhaps with a bit of added convenience. However, the mechanism is much more extensible and flexible than what we have now:</p>
<ul>
<li>we can apply it to atomic types that currently have no decomposition operators, such as gMonthDay</li>
<li>we can easily add additional components such as <code>day-of-week</code> or <code>quarter</code> or <code>day-of-year</code> or <code>julian-day</code> that are currently not available, or only available clumsily using format-dateTime().</li>
<li>the parts() function is polymorphic, so the same code can be used to get the year (say) from a date, a dateTime, or a gYearMonth.</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't detected a great deal of enthusiasm for this idea, and I can see it causing some confusion, partly because Unicode offers such a wide choice of symbols some of which are visually very similar.</p>
<p>I propose retaining a much smaller set of these symbols:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"÷" (xF7) for "div" because the symbol is widely recognised and "div" here is pretty ugly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"≺" (x227A) and "≻" (x227B) as alternatives to "&lt;" and "&gt;" in all operator symbols (other than XML markup contexts) that use these characters: for readability in contexts, especially XSLT, where the "&lt;" and "&gt;" characters need to be escaped</p>

<p>The idea is to define 3 parsing strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>numeric</code> -- number-like systems such as decimal;</li>
<li><code>alphabetic</code> -- alphabetical-like systems such as spreadsheet columns (A, B, ..., Z, AA, AB, ...)</li>
<li><code>additive</code> -- systems like roman and hebrew where the symbol represents a fixed value that is added together</li>
</ol>
<p>Parsing these, we have 3 properties:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>system as enum("numeric", "alphabetic", "additive") := "numeric"</code> -- which of the parsing strategies (number systems) to use;</li>
<li><code>symbols as xs:string := "0123456789"</code> -- the list of characters used to represent a digit;</li>
<li><code>additive-symbols as map(xs:integer, xs:string) := map {}</code> -- a map of the symbols in an additive system with the corresponding value of that symbol.</li>
</ol>
<p>Consideration 1 -- Should these also allow any whitespace and optional "+"/"-" symbols like the radix-based parse-integer?</p>
<p>Consideration 2 -- Should we define decimal format options for these, so the decimal format name can format/represent other number systems (binary, hex, hebrew, tamil, roman numerals, etc.). -- Note: this would make <code>system</code>, <code>symbols</code>, and <code>additive-symbols</code> properties of the decimal format object with the above defaults. The formatting would work in the same way as it is defined in the CSS Counter Styles specification.</p>
<h2>Design 1 -- Separate functions</h2>
<pre><code>fn:parse-numeric-integer($value as xs:string,
                         $symbols as xs:string := "0123456789") as xs:integer

fn:parse-alphabetic-integer($value as xs:string,
                            $symbols as xs:string := "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ") as xs:integer

fn:parse-additive-integer($value as xs:string,
                          $additive-symbols as map(xs:integer, xs:string)) as xs:integer
</code></pre>
<h2>Design 2 -- Combined functions</h2>
<pre><code>fn:parse-integer($value as xs:string,
                 $system as xs:string := "numeric",
                 $symbols as xs:string := "0123456789",
                 $additive-symbols as map(xs:integer, xs:string) := map {}) as xs:integer

<p>One question for the group is what the name of the function should be (including the choice of namespace).</p>
<p>Another is whether the polarity of the callback function should be changed (from <code>break-when</code> to <code>continue-when</code> or similar).</p>
<p>We could also consider returning an array of sequences rather than a sequence of arrays. (But in my view sequences of arrays are rather easier to manage at the moment.)</p>
