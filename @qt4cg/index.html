<blockquote>
<p>By default, this function is [·deterministic·]. This means that repeated calls on the function with the same argument will return the same result. However, for performance reasons, implementations may provide a user option to evaluate the function without a guarantee of determinism. The manner in which any such option is provided is [·implementation-defined·]. If the user has not selected such an option, a call to this function must either return a deterministic result or must raise a dynamic error [[err:FODC0003].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is unrealistic. The cost of making fn:collection deterministic is disproportionate to the benefits. It's very rare in practice for a query or stylesheet to process the same collection more than once, and retaining the information needed to deliver the identical results on these rare occasions is expensive (typically it means holding a long-term lock on the data, or keeping a copy of the entire collection in memory). It also inhibits techniques such as multi-threaded evaluation.</p>
<p>I would like to relax this requirement.</p>

The proposal is incomplete, for example it does not include all the rules for conversions and casting. This issue is raised in order to outline where we are, what needs to be done, and to elicit consensus on whether we want to proceed with this.</p>
<p>What's the motivation? Primarily, making function signatures more expressive.</p>
<p><em>Q0: do we really need this?</em></p>
<p>The essence of the proposal is an ItemType that matches an enumerated set of xs:string values:</p>
<p><code>[131] | EnumerationType | ::= | "enum" "("&nbsp;&nbsp;StringLiteral&nbsp;(","&nbsp;&nbsp;StringLiteral)* ")"  </code>
For example, the type enum("red", "green", "blue") matches the string "green".</p>
<p><em>Q1: why restrict it to strings? I think my main reason was that the syntax gets complicated if we try to do it for data types that have no literal representation.</em></p>
<p>Subtyping is based on the value space. An enumeration type E is a subtype of another enumeration type F if the set of strings in E is a subset of those in F. All enumeration types are subtypes of xs:string.</p>
<p>Strings are not "labelled" as belonging to an enumeration type, matching is purely based on the value ("datum"). This doesn't provide very strong typing. If "violet" and "pink" are allowed by both the enumeration types <code>colour</code> and <code>flower</code>, then it's not intrinsically an error to use a variable of type <code>flower</code> where a <code>colour</code> is expected. Equally, a variable of type <code>xs:string</code> can be used where a <code>colour</code> is expected.</p>
<p><em>Q2: should enumerations be more strongly typed?</em></p>
<p>I would expect that an enumeration type can be used as the target of "cast" or "castable", but this is not currently in the spec.</p>
<p>The coercion rules as currently written say that if the expected type is an enumeration type, then the rules are largely the same as for any other subtype of <code>xs:string</code>:  casting from <code>xs:untypedAtomic</code> applies, promotion from <code>xs:anyURI</code> does not apply, 1.0 compatibility mode rules do not apply.</p>
<p>Operators and functions on enumeration types are the same as for <code>xs:string</code>. This means, for example, that there are no special rules for comparison: values are ordered as strings and are compared using the default collation.</p>

<h1><br>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>As shown in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation#Support_in_common_programming_and_scripting_languages">Wikipedia</a>, most contemporary programming languages offer reasonable support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation#Definition">short-circuit evaluation</a>
(also known as <em>minimal</em> or <em>McCarthy evaluation</em>), including several standard language short-circuit operators.</p>
<p>Short-circuiting, as we will call the above in this document, is commonly used to achieve:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Avoiding undesired side effects of evaluating the second argument</em>, such as
excessive evaluation time or throwing an error</li>
</ol>
<p>Usual example, using a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C-based</a>&nbsp;language:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">   int denom = 0;
   if (denom != 0 &amp;&amp; num / denom)
   {
   ...//ensures that calculating num/denom never results in divide-by-zero error
   }
</code></pre>
<p>Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">   int a = 0;
   if (a != 0 &amp;&amp; myfunc(b))
   {
     do_something();
   }
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, short-circuit evaluation guarantees that&nbsp;<code>myfunc(b)</code>&nbsp;is never called. This is because&nbsp;<code>a&nbsp;!= 0</code>&nbsp;evaluates to&nbsp;<em><code>false</code></em>. This feature permits two useful programming constructs.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the first sub-expression checks whether an expensive computation is needed and the check evaluates to&nbsp;<em>false</em>, one can eliminate expensive computation in the second argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It permits a construct where the first expression guarantees a condition without which the second expression may cause a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_error">run-time error</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Idiomatic conditional construct</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a>&nbsp;idioms:</p>
<pre><code>   some_condition or die; # Abort execution if some_condition is false

   some_condition and die; # Abort execution if some_condition is true
</code></pre>
<h1><br>2. Short-circuiting in XPath</h1>
<p>In short (pun intended) there is no such thing mentioned in any officially-published W3C version (&lt;= 3.1) of XPath.</p>
<p>This topic was briefly mentioned in the discussion of <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/78">another proposal</a>: that of providing the capability to specify strictly the order of evaluation.</p>
<p>Aspects of incorporating hints for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation">lazy evaluation</a> (a topic related to short-cutting) were discussed also in the thread to <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T011VK9115Z/C01GVC3JLHE/thread/C01GVC3JLHE-1665542903.180989">this question</a> on the Xml.com Slack.</p>
<p>The situation at present is that the XPath processor that is being used decides whether or not to perform shortcutting, even in obvious cases. Thus, varying from one XPath processor to another, the differences in performance evaluation could be dramatic. For example, the following XPath expression is evaluated on BaseX (ver. &gt;= 10.3) for 0 seconds, and the same expression is evaluated by Saxon ver. 11 for about 100 seconds.</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">
let $fnAnd := function($x)
   {
     function($y)
     {
      if(not($x)) then false()
                  else $y
     }
   }
   return
      $fnAnd(false())(some $b in ( ((1 to 1000000000000000000) !true()) )  satisfies not($b)   )
</code></pre>
<h2><br>3. Analysis</h2>
<p>We can define the term “<em>function with shortcutting</em>” (just for a 2-argument function, but this can be extended for <code>N</code>-argument function where <code>N &gt;= 2</code>) in the  following way:</p>
<p>Given a function <code>$f($x, $y)</code>, we denote in XPath its partial application for a given value of $x (say <code>let $x := $t</code>) as:</p>
<p><code>$f($t, ?)</code></p>
<p>The above is a function of one argument. By definition:</p>
<p><code>$f($x, $y)</code> is equivalent to <code>$f($x, ?) ($y)</code>, for every pair <code>$x</code> and <code>$y</code>.</p>
<p>That is, the partial application of the 2-argument function <code>$f</code> with fixed 1st argument is another function <code>$g</code> which when applied on the 2nd argument (<code>$y</code>) of <code>$f($x, $y)</code> produces the same value as <code>$f($x, $y)</code>:</p>
<p>If <code>$g</code> is defined as <code>$f($x, ?)</code>, then <code>$g($y)</code> produces the same value as <code>$f($x, $y)</code> for every pair <code>$x</code> and <code>$y</code>.</p>
<p>Let us take a specific function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $fAnd := function($x as xs:boolean, $y as xs:boolean) as xs:boolean
                     { $x and $y}
</code></pre>
<p>Then one equivalent way of defining <code>$fAnd</code> is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $fAnd := function($x as xs:boolean, $y as xs:boolean) as xs:boolean
                     {
                       let $partial := function($x as xs:boolean) as function(xs:boolean) as xs:boolean
                                               {
                                                  if(not($x)) then -&gt;(){false()}
                                                              else -&gt;($t) {$t}
                                               }
                         return $partial($x)($y)
                    }
   return
       $fAnd(false(), true())
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong><em><code>$partial</code></em></strong> function is the result of the partial application <code>$fAnd($x, ?)</code> and by definition this is a function of arity 1, which when applied on the 2nd argument of <code>$fAnd</code>, produces the same result as <code>$fAnd($x, $y)</code></p>
<p>From the code above we see that actually there exists a value of <code>$x</code> (the value <code>false()</code> ) for which <code>$fAnd($x, ?)</code> is not a function of one argument, but a constant function (of <strong>0</strong> arguments) – that produces the value <code>false()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:</p>
<p>We say that a function <code>f(x, y)</code> <em><strong>allows shortcutting</strong></em> if there exists at least one value <code>t</code> such that</p>
<p><code>f(t, ?)</code> is a constant.</p>
<h1><br>4. Solution</h1>
<p><strong>How can an XPath processor treat a function with shortcutting?</strong></p>
<p>Obviously, if the XPath processor knows that <code>f(x, y)</code> allows shortcutting, then it becomes possible to delay the evaluation of the 2nd argument <code>y</code> and only perform this evaluation if the arity of the function returned by <code>f(t, ?)</code> is <code>1</code>, and not <code>0</code>.</p>
<p><strong>How can an XPath processor know that a given function allows shortcutting?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One way to obtain this knowledge is to evaluate <code>f(t, ?)</code> and get the arity of the resulting function. XPath 3.1 allows getting the arity of any function item with the function <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/#func-function-arity">fn:function-arity()</a>.      However, doing this on every function call could be expensive and deteriorate performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another way of informing the XPath processor that a given function <code>f(x, y)</code> allows shortcutting is if the language provides <em><strong>hints for lazy evaluation</strong></em>:
<br>let $fAnd := function($x as xs:boolean, <em><strong>lazy</strong></em> $y as xs:boolean) as xs:boolean<br>
<br>Only in the case when there is a <em><strong>lazy</strong></em> hint specified the XPath processor will check the arity of <code>f(x, ?)</code> and will not need to evaluate the <code>y</code> argument if this arity is <code>0</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us return to the original example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $fAnd := function($x as xs:boolean, $y as xs:boolean) as xs:boolean
                     {
                       let $partial := function($x as xs:boolean) as function(xs:boolean) as xs:boolean
                                               {
                                                  if(not($x)) then -&gt;(){false()}
                                                              else -&gt;($t) {$t}
                                               }
                         return $partial($x)($y)
                    }
   return
       $fAnd(false(), true())
</code></pre>
<p>Executing this with an Xpath 3.1 processor, an error is raised: “<em>1 argument supplied, 0 expected: function() as xs:boolean { false() }.</em>”</p>

<p>But according to the updated “<a href="https://qt4cg.org/pr/279/xquery-40/xpath-40.html#id-coercion-rules">Coercion Rules / Function Coercion</a>” in Xpath 4.0, no error will occur:</p>

<p><em>For example, if the expected type is&nbsp;<code>function(node(), xs:boolean) as  xs:string</code>, and the supplied function is&nbsp;<code>fn:name#1</code>, then the supplied function is effectively replaced by&nbsp;<code>function($n as node(), $b as xs:boolean) as xs:string {fn:name($n)}</code></em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly the place where the XPath processor will call the lower-arity function without providing to it the ignored, and not needed to be evaluated, additional argument.</p>
<p>Thus, according to this rule, an XPath 4.0 processor will successfully evaluate the above expression and will not issue the error shown above.</p>
<p>Finally, we can put the <em>lazy</em> hint on a function declaration or on a function call, or on both places:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $fAnd := function($x as xs:boolean, lazy $y as xs:boolean) as  xs:boolean
   {
     let $partial := function($x as xs:boolean) as function(lazy xs:boolean) as xs:boolean
                           {
                              if(not($x)) then -&gt;(){false()}
                                          else -&gt;($t) {$t}
                           }
      return $partial($x)( lazy $y)
   }
   return
       $fAnd(false(), lazy true())

<p><strong><em>How to write short-circuiting functions?</em></strong></p>
<p>The code above is a good example how one can write a short-circuiting function evaluating which the XPath processor would be aware that a short-circuit is happening but instead of signaling arity error as an XPath 3.1 processor does, will logically ignore the unneeded 2nd argument.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>(emphasis added by me)</p>
<p>What in the name of all things is that about? I've never noticed that before, and I haven't seen any other API (the URL API in Node and the browser for example) that cares.</p>
<p><code>resolve-uri('test.xml', 'http://example.com/path/file.xml#foo')</code> === <code>http://example.com/path/test.xml</code></p>
<p>I don't see why the presence of a fragment identifier should matter in the least.</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; let url = new URL("http://example.com/path/file.xml#foo")
&gt;&gt; console.log(url.href)
http://example.com/path/file.xml#foo
&gt;&gt; let resolved = new URL("test.xml", url);
&gt;&gt; console.log(resolved.href)
http://example.com/path/test.xml
</code></pre>

For example, fn:head() returns an empty sequence if the input is empty, while array:head() throws an error.</p>
<p>Sometimes we want the error, sometimes we don't, but this should be orthogonal to whether we are using sequences or arrays.</p>
<p>Is there a way we can adapt the sequence functions to throw an error, or adapt the array functions so they don't?</p>
<p>Various ideas have been put forward, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>add extra optional parameters to functions to select the behaviour</li>
<li>mirror the relevant functions (e.g. into a different namespace) to create an alternative version with different behaviour</li>
<li>add options to the static context (array-bound-checking=yes|no, sequence-bound-checking=yes|no) to switch the behaviour (with appropriate mechanisms in XQuery and XSLT -- and perhaps XPath -- to set these options)</li>
<li>do nothing, let users solve the problem for themselves by writing user-defined functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note 1: the difference in behaviour affects operators as well as functions: contrast <code>$seq[0]</code> (which returns ()) with <code>$array(0)</code> (throws error). Making <code>$seq[0]</code> throw an error would mean we have to define it in a different way, since the formulation <code>$seq[position()=$N]</code> is intrinsically error-free.</p>
<p>Note 2: if <code>$array(0)</code> doesn't throw an error, it's not immediately obvious what it should do. Returning an empty sequence isn't ideal because the empty sequence is a valid entry in an array. For maps we have the same problem, which is why we have two functions <code>map:get()</code> and <code>map:contains()</code>.</p>

<p>In the 4.0 spec we appear to disallow this with the paragraph (in §10.3.4):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A stylesheet function may be overridden by another stylesheet function with the same name that has higher [import precedence]. This is only allowed, however, if the [arity range] of the overriding function includes the totality of the arity range of the overridden function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, the error conditions we go on to define (XTSE0769 and XTSE0770) are more carefully worded and do not make the above situation an error. XTSE0769 says that if F has higher import precedence than G, then either the arity ranges of F and G must be disjoint, or the arity range of F must include the totality of G. XTSE0770 says that if F and G have the same import precedence, then their arity ranges must be disjoint.</p>
<p>The paragraph cited should be replaced with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A stylesheet function may be overridden by another stylesheet function with the same name that has higher [import precedence]. This is only allowed, however, if either (a) the [arity range] of the overriding function includes the totality of the arity range of the overridden function, or (b) the two arity ranges are non-overlapping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also scope for editorial improvement to §10.3.4. It describes three separate scenarios:</p>
<p>(a) overriding functions using xsl:import and import precedence</p>
<p>(b) overriding functions using xsl:use-package and xsl:override</p>
<p>(c) overriding extension/external functions using xsl:function (or vice versa)</p>
<p>and it would be much easier to read the section if these were clearly distinguished.</p>

<p>Repeat after me, "filenames are not URIs." Not on some platforms, anyway.</p>
<p>I still get a warning about "correctness" because of the interaction between a couple of tasks. That doesn't happen on a *nix platform so I don't know if it's related to the difference between forward and backward slashes or if it's a consequence of the build changes I made to support the new SVG (that might be) in data model. They seem harmless for the moment.</p>
