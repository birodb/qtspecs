<p>On the one hand, in order for <code>fn:deep-equal</code> to be most easily used as a comparison function in the many contexts where a comparison function is required, it would be best if it simply returned <code>false()</code> rather than raising an error when incomparably items are encountered.</p>
<p>On the other hand, making "return false()" the default will mean that it is possible to construct items that are not equal to themselves, which will certainly violate the expectations of some users.</p>
<p>This conflict needs to be resolved somehow.</p>

<p>The specification would be something like,
Elements and attributes associated with an ignored element prefix are not treated as direct constructors, and are removed when the stylesheet is compiled. For such an element, this is equivalent to having an xsl:use-when attribute with value false on the element; for attributes, they are simply discarded along with their value.</p>
<p>It is not an error for a prefix to be listed both as an ignored element prefix and as an extension element prefix; the result is implementation dependent in this case, but MUST not result in neither an extension being invoked nor the element or attribute being ignored.</p>
<p>Ignored elements may appear anywhere in the input tree, and ignored attributes may appear on any element.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;xsl:template match="city/park" css:module="main"&gt;
  &lt;css:rule&gt;
    color: green;
    trees: tall;

It's not at all clear why these should be the same. For types, the vast majority of QNames representing types are in the XML Schema namespace, which is never used for elements.</p>
<p>In the current 4.0 drafts the two default namespaces are separated; but this has not been reviewed or agreed by the CG. This issue is raised for discussion of the change, and I will also review the design to see whether it still make sense.</p>
<p>Some observations on the current text for XQuery:</p>
<ol>
<li>In section 2.2.1 (static context) it would be good to give a bit more detail (if only as a forwards reference) about the circumstances in which the default element namespace and the default type namespace are used.</li>
<li>In 3.4 Sequence Types the sentence "[Lexical QNames]appearing in a [sequence type] have their prefixes expanded to namespace URIs by means of the [statically known namespaces] and (where applicable) the [default element namespace] or [default type namespace]" is rather inelegantly worded. If there is a prefix, then the statically known namespaces are used; if there is none, then the relevant default namespace is used, and it would be nice to explain more clearly which one applies.</li>
<li>In 3.6 Item Types, we need to be clearer about references to named/declared item types, and about how the names are resolved. Do we really want these names to be in the same symbol space as atomic types? Perhaps we should have a rule that Item Types (like functions) must be in a namespace and this must not be the same as an imported schema namespace.</li>
<li>In 5.14, Default namespace declaration, there seems to be duplication between the two paragraphs starting "for backwards compatibility reasons"</li>
<li>Appendix C.1 (much though I dislike it) should say something about the initialisation of the default namespaces for elements and for types.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that issue #65 talks of the need for different default namespaces for input and output elements. I think that's a separate issue.</p>
<p>Observations on the current text for XSLT:</p>
<ol>
<li>In 5.1.2.1 the paragraph "The [xsl:]xpath-default-namespace attribute must be in the [XSLT namespace] if and only if its parent element is not in the XSLT namespace needs to be generalised to [xsl:]default-element-namespace. In fact, this rule should move to the parent section 5.1.2, which needs an introduction.</li>
</ol>

Essentially, I think "namespace clutter".</p>
<p>Namespace clutter manifests itself in several different ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, declaration clutter in source code. Here's the start of a module in an XSLT Stylesheet of medium complexity:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet 
    xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" 
    xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" 
    exclude-result-prefixes="#all"
    version="3.0" 
    xmlns="http://ns.saxonica.com/xslt/export" 
    xmlns:doc="http://www.saxonica.com/ns/documentation"
    xmlns:map="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/map" 
    xmlns:ex="http://ns.saxonica.com/xslt/export" 
    xmlns:f="MyFunctions" 
    xmlns:t="MyTypes"
    expand-text="true"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Eight namespace declarations here, of which 3 are concerned with functions; and  Wit can get a lot worse than that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Secondly, namespace clutter in the static and dynamic context. The namespace bindings shown above don't disappear when the code is compiled; even with exclude-result-prefixes="yes", they have to hang around at run-time just in case someone tries to resolve a QName dynamically. Preserving the namespace context in the expression tree through optimization rewrites is a significant cost that has no user benefit; very rarely are they actually going to use the namespace context at run time.</li>
<li>Thirdly, prefix clutter in the executable code. Writing <code>math:cos(math:cos($x))</code> is just so clumsy compared with <code>cos(cos($x))</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think there are a number of things we can do to reduce this.</p>
<p>First, separate out the namespace context for static resolution of function names as a separate part of the static context, used only for this purpose. Ensure that there is no functionality that depends on knowing this part of the static context at run time, so it can be discarded by the compiler as soon as function names are resolved. Then provide source syntax for binding function prefixes to function namespaces in XSLT and XQuery to populate this part of the static context; there is no reason this has to be done using XML namespace declarations. There is also no reason for having different bindings in force in different parts of a single module. And once we've separated these declarations from XML namespace declarations, there's no reason why we can't provide default bindings. We could also allow bindings to have cross-module scope to reduce duplicated code. Note: the xsl:function-library proposal in the current XSLT 4.0 draft tries to achieve some of these things.</p>
<p>Second, allow functions to be referenced by local name alone where the reference is unambiguous; and perhaps provide some aliasing mechanisms to make more existing names unambiguous.</p>
<p>We've explored a third idea, which is to introduce some kind of polymorphism where function names have local scope and are distinguished by the types of objects to which they are applied. I think that given our type system, this is very hard to achieve and I haven't seen any very satisfactory proposals. We also need to remember that there are considerable costs if we start resolving function names dynamically at run time. I wouldn't rule out making progress in this direction, but I'm not optimistic of coming up with a workable solution. There might be some simple things we could do, like having a single function <code>size()</code> that performs the work of both <code>map:size()</code> and <code>array:size()</code> depending on the argument.</p>

F(., B, C)</code> which means that B and C are evaluated with a focus based on the current item in A, not with the outer focus. This is different from the <code>=&gt;</code> operator. For example if the $E is an element E, with several children called F, then</p>
<p><code>namespace-uri(.) -&gt; fn:QName(name())</code></p>
<p>has a different effect from</p>
<p><code>namespace-uri(.) =&gt; fn:QName(name())</code></p>
<p>whereas it might reasonably be expected that in the case where the LHS produces a single value, the two operators are equivalent. We can't change the meaning of <code>=&gt;</code> because it's defined in 3.1. So should we change the meaning of <code>-&gt;</code> to fall into line?</p>
<p>We could do this easily enough by defining <code>A -&gt; F(B, C)</code> as equivalent to <code>for $a in A return F($a, B, C)</code>.  I think that as well as being more consistent with <code>=&gt;</code>, the result is probably more intuitive. (We could also define it as equivalent to <code>let $f := F(?, B, C) return A ! $f(.)</code>)</p>
<p>For the expression <code>A -&gt; {B}</code>, and for the proposed <code>A =&gt; {B}</code>, I don't think we have any choice other than evaluating B with an inner focus based on A. But at least we can do it consistently for both operators.</p>

I propose to allow <code>xsl:use-package</code> to contain zero or more <code>xsl:package-location</code> children. I propose the addition of an element and not an attribute, because a package may be in multiple locations, and need nuance, as noted below.</p>
<p>Attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>@href</code>, on the model of <code>xsl:import</code> and <code>xsl:include</code>, would specify by relative or absolute URI where the package is.</li>
<li><code>@priority</code> (default 0) would provide a mechanism to indicate whether the specified <code>xsl:package-location</code> should override (value greater than 0), or simply provide a fallback for (less than or equal to 0), the preconfigured place the package should be retrieved from.</li>
<li><code>@use-when</code> would allow a developer to manage different versions of a package for different cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other attributes given to <code>xsl:package-location</code> would need discussion.</p>

switch($item) {
