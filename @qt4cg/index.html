<p>TODO: define default priorities for type patterns, as suggested in https://www.saxonica.com/papers/xmlprague-2020mhk.pdf section 6.5.1</p>
<p>We need to plug this gap. [Note: it's worth reading that cited section as it points out some of the difficulties].</p>
<p>I'm going to suggest an alternative approach. Rather than allocating a numeric priority to patterns such as <code>record(lat, long)</code>, we allocate them a relative priority -- called their <code>selectivity</code> -- based on the subtype relationship among types. This is a partial ordering. So we extend the rule that currently orders patterns by (1) import precedence, (2) priority, (3) declaration order, to become instead (1) import precedence, (2) selectivity, (3) priority, (4) declaration order.</p>
<p>Type-based patterns (such as <code>type(xs:integer)</code>, <code>record(lat, long)</code>) are defined to have higher selectivity than any non-type-based pattern; all the latter (that is, all XSLT 3.1 patterns) are defined to have equal selectivity, which means the rules for discriminating among 3.1 patterns are unchanged.</p>
<p>For type-based patterns, we define that a pattern based on type T has higher selectivity than a pattern based on type U if T is a subtype of U. If neither is a subtype of the other, then they have equal selectivity.</p>
<p>The type pattern <code>type(T)</code> followed by one or more predicates is deemed to have higher selectivity than type(T) with no predicates, but apart from this, the predicates are ignored. Explicit numeric priorities can be used to define an ordering among type patterns that have the same selectivity.</p>

<div class="toot" id="created-397"><h2>Issue #397 created<span class="toot-id"> #created-397</span></h2><div class="pubdate">14 Mar at 21:46:13 GMT</div><div class="link">Link: <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/397">https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/397</a></div><details><summary>Type names</summary><div class="markup"><p>The draft specifications propose the introduction of item type declarations that can associate a name with an item type. The feature probably still needs some work, which this issue aims to explore.</p>
<p>The main purpose of introducing named item types is that the ItemType for a record structure or a function signature can become quite complex and lengthy, and you don't want to have to repeat them every time they are used because it means you have to make the same change everywhere when a change occurs. Another motivation is to allow type definitions (for example, of records or functions) to be recursive.</p>
<p>I considered allowing named sequence types rather than just item types, but the rules for where you can and can't have an occurrence indicator get complicated, so I pulled back from that.</p>
<p>It seems natural to say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Item type names are QNames</li>
<li>In XPath, type names (and their mapping to item types) appear in the static context</li>
<li>In XQuery, type names follow the conventions for global variables and function declarations. That suggests they can appear either in the main module or a library module; in a library module they must be in the namespace of the module; they can be annotated as %public or %private; an <code>import module</code> declaration makes the name visible in the importing module.</li>
<li>In XSLT, a name declared in a module is automatically available throughout the stylesheet package, and can be exposed to other packages using the same visibility mechanisms as other stylesheet components. However, I don't think it makes sense to allow a type name to be overridden, either using import precedence or using xsl:override.</li>
</ul>
<p>The question then arises, should item type names be in the same "symbol space" as named atomic and union types? There seem to be several options here:</p>
<p>(a) Item type names are in a different symbol space from atomic types; the are no rules barring the same name being used for a named item type and an atomic type, and they are disambiguated by requiring item type names to be distinguished using some kind of marker syntax such as <code>type(name)</code>, rather than just a bare name.
(b) Item type names are in the same symbol space as atomic types, which means there must be a rule that an item type name must not be the same as an atomic type name that is visible in the same place. We could try and define this rule for individual names, or at the level of namespaces (if there are any atomic/union types in a particular namespace in the static context of any module, then there must be no declared type names in that namespace in that module, either declared in that module or imported from another module).
(c) Atomic type names "shadow" item type names, or vice versa: if the same name is used for both, then one of them takes precedence. Probably not a good idea.</p>
<p>I'm inclined to go for (b). Note that a simple rule that item type names can't be in a reserved namespace will prevent conflict for all non-schema-aware applications, since those applications only access atomic types in the <code>xs</code> namespace.</p>
<p>Now, what about circular definitions?</p>
<p>There are legitimate circular definitions, like <code>declare item type LIST = record(payload as item()*, next? as LIST)</code>, and there are "impossible" definitions, like <code>declare item type THING = THING</code>. Do we have to define the rules needed to ban "impossible" definitions, or can we just leave it that the determination of whether something is an instance of THING is non-terminating? I think we probably need to define the rules, which will require careful thought.</p>
<p>Where can item type names be used? The simple answer is: anywhere an ItemType is allowed. But what about contexts that only allow some ItemTypes and not others? For example, (a) "cast as", (b) as arguments of a LocalUnionType, (c) as the key type in a map type. (The solution in the current draft is that the syntax allows any ItemType to be used in these contexts, and there are semantic rules to constrain what kind of item types are allowed).</p>
<p>If we allow <code>$v cast as my:X</code> where <code>my:X</code> is a declared item type name, should we also allow the constructor function  <code>my:X($v)</code>? That would presumably also mean that item type names and function names cannot overlap.</p>
<p>Should we define any "built-in" item type names? We've been defining built-in functions (such as build-uri and parse-uri) whose signatures use record type definitions. Should we define built-in names for these record definitions?</p>
<p>An editorial issue: I think it's becoming increasingly difficult to get away with overloading the word <code>ItemType</code> to mean both the abstract concept of an item type, and the specific BNF construct used to define it. Same for <code>SequenceType</code>. I think we should probably move to having a defined term "item type" and a BNF construct such as <code>ItemTypeDesignator</code> to represent the two separate meanings.</p>

<p>When <code>fn:build-uri</code> parses that map, it produces: <code>querty://abc</code> because the scheme is not known to be non-hierarchical.</p>
<p>This PR changes <code>fn:parse-uri</code> so that it records whether or not the URI was hierarchical and <code>fn:build-uri</code> to use that information.</p>
<p>It's possible that we could finesse this by setting the <code>authority</code> to the empty string for hierarchical URIs, but it seems clearer to be explicit.</p>
<p>This PR also fixes a bug. Previously, if the <code>scheme</code> was not present when building a URI, the URI began with <code>//</code>. That's an error. If the scheme isn't present, there should be no <em>scheme separator</em>.</p>

It doesn't help that there's no official RFC for <code>file:</code> URIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>file:/path/part</code> is a <code>file:</code> URI with no host and a path of <code>/path/part</code>.</li>
<li><code>file:///path.part</code> is a <code>file:</code> URI with an explicitly empty host and a path of <code>/path/part</code>.</li>
<li><code>file://path/part</code> is a <code>file:</code> URI with an authority of <code>path</code> and a path of <code>/part</code>. I think one common way to interpret this is as if it was <code>file:/part</code>. That is, in <code>file:</code> URIs, although a different host is possible, it's often just ignored.</li>
<li><code>c:\path\part</code> is most usefully interpreted as <code>file:/c:/path/part</code>, a <code>file:</code> URI with no host and a path of <code>/c:/path/part</code>. These are only going to be useful on a Windows system, so it isn't a problem to treat them the same way on all platforms. (Aside: I don't actually know if the path part should be <code>c:/path/part</code> instead, but it's currently got the leading slash in <code>fn:parse-uri()</code>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there's this: <code>file:////name/path/part</code>.</p>
<p>One interpretation is, "look, we accept <code>file:/</code> and <code>file:///</code> so let's just accept <code>file://</code> and <code>file://///////</code>, etc. as the same." And I think that's generally right, with the single special exception of <code>file:////</code>. The problem is that on Windows, this is a very common way to encode the URI for a UNC path, that is: <code>\\name\path\part</code> which is a Windows UNC path for <code>\path\part</code> on a host named <code>name</code> (via whatever networking protocol backs UNC).</p>
<p>You'd think that this should be <code>file://name/path/part</code>, but I think because browsers and maybe other tools just discard the authority part of a <code>file:</code> URI (or maybe because these are <em>paths</em> in some Windows sense?), that's not how they're encoded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: Yes, I'm sure you also see <code>file:\\\\name\path\part</code> and <code>file:c:\path\part</code> and other forms as well. Those are out of scope, they're simply, flatly, completely wrong. You can't use <code>\</code> as a delimiter in a URI. RFC 3986 is authoritative on this point. Step one of dealing with random strings we think should be URIs is replacing all <code>\</code> with <code>/</code> because RFC 3986.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's problematic to deal with <code>file:////</code> as a special case, but it's also problematic to leave out support for a common pattern on a widely deployed operating system.</p>
<p>Recognizing four slashes after <code>file:</code> and treating that specially isn't hard. The hard part is how do we encode this in the map that <code>fn:parse-uri</code> produces bearing in mind that the result should round-trip if you push it back through <code>fn:build-uri</code>.</p>
<p>Consider <code>file:////uncname/path/part</code></p>
<p>Today, that is parsed as:</p>
<pre><code>map {
  "uri": "file:////uncname/path/part",
  "scheme": "file",
  "authority": "uncname",
  "host": "uncname",
  "path": "/path/to/file",
  "path-segments": array { "", "path", "to", "file" }
}
</code></pre>
<p>and that doesn’t round trip. If you feed that to <code>fn:build-uri</code>, you get <code>file://uncname/path/part</code> and that absolutely doesn’t mean the same thing on a Windows machine.</p>
<p>We could encode the slashes in the <code>authority</code> in which case we also have to encode them in the <code>host</code> because in the presence of <code>host</code>, the <code>authority</code> isn’t used to by <code>fn:build-uri()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>map {
  "uri": "file:////uncname/path/part",
  "scheme": "file",
  "authority": "////uncname",
  "host": "////uncname",
  "path": "/path/to/file",
  "path-segments": array { "", "path", "to", "file" }
}
</code></pre>
<p>It kind of works, but it’s really ugly and it means we have a host value that is a complete kludge. It doesn’t match the RFC rules for hostnames at all.</p>
<p>The other option that occurs to me is to add a “unc-path” property to the map:</p>
<pre><code>map {
  "unc-path": true(),
  "uri": "file:////uncname/path/part",
  "scheme": "file",
  "authority": "uncname",
  "host": "uncname",
  "path": "/path/to/file",
  "path-segments": array { "", "path", "to", "file" }
}
</code></pre>
<p>That works but it introduces all sorts of possibilities for incoherent data, such as an <code>https:</code> URI with a <code>unc-path</code> flag set to <code>true()</code>.</p>
<p>What’s the right answer?</p>
<ol>
<li>Ignore the UNC path special case, it’s the users problem to deal with them.</li>
<li>Recognize them, encode the details in the <code>authority</code> and <code>host</code>.</li>
<li>Recognize them, use a special property like <code>unc-path</code>.</li>
<li>Recognize them, and do this other much better idea I have: ________________</li>
