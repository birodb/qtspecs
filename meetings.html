<p>This page provides links to the mailing list archives and
instructions for subscribing (and unsubscribing) from the list.</p>

<p>Note: The official name of the group is the XSLT Extensions
Community Group but it’s become common to refer to it as “QT4”
because many of us used to refer to the XQuery/XSLT work as “qt”.
Our aims are wider than just XSLT extensions, but for organizational
reasons, it might be simplest not to attempt to change the name at
the present time.</p>
