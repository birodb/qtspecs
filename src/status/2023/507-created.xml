   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;125: Rename array:partition as fn:partition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reworked this PR to deal with merge conflicts. Technical change was already accepted. Made a correction to the "equivalent expression" published in the spec, which has now been tested (and was found wanting...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
