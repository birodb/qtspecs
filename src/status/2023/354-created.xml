   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combine multiple signatures of XSLT functions to use defaults&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This PR addresses issue 69, by modifying those XSLT built-in functions that currently have multiple signatures, to use a single signature with parameter defaults instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes however don't currently render correctly. The XSLT processing pipeline needs to be changed to pick up the changes that were made to the F+O stylesheets to render parameter defaults correctly. I haven't yet managed to work out where this is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
