   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;parse-xml() and whitespace stripping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be nothing in either the XSLT spec or in F+O that says explicitly whether stylesheet-defined space stripping rules (xsl:strip-space and xsl:preserve-space) apply to documents loaded using &lt;code&gt;fn:parse-xml&lt;/code&gt; (or, by extension, &lt;code&gt;parse-html&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spec says that these rules apply to "source trees" defined as "any tree provided as input to the transformation. This includes the document containing the [global context item] if any, documents containing nodes present in the [initial match selection], documents containing nodes supplied as the values of [stylesheet parameters], documents obtained from the results of functions such as [document], [doc], and [collection]...".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess one reasonable interpretation is that the "such as" includes &lt;code&gt;parse-xml()&lt;/code&gt;. But it goes rather against the grain that the behaviour of parse-xml() should be affected by the containing stylesheet declarations, when there is no mention of such a context-dependency in the function specification; in this, parse-xml() is rather different from doc() which deliberately says very little about how the XDM instance returned relates to the URI supplied as input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
