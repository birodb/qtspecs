   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;520: add function identity and use it in deep-equal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe this PR resolves issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;issue #520 - function identity
issue #333 - equality of function items
issue #381 - deep-equal comparison without errors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PR introduces a concept of function identity in the data model, and for all expressions that create functions, explains what the identity of the returned function is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of function identity is used initially in two places: in fn:deep-equal(), when the operands include function items; and in the F+O prose defining the concept of determinism, which in turn is relied on by the definition of memo functions in XSLT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had hoped to go further and address issue #119, generalising what kinds of values are allowed as keys in maps, but as explained in a comment on that issue, I hit obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
