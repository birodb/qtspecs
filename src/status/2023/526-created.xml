   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;load-xquery-module() needs changes to account for functions with an arity range&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spec of &lt;code&gt;load-xquery-module()&lt;/code&gt; assumes that each function declaration in a query module has a single integer arity; this doesn't allow for default parameters which mean it now has an arity range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the returned map contains function items, which always have a fixed arity, I think it needs to contain one entry for each arity in the arity range. This involves evaluating the defaults for any parameters that have a default value defined; if the default value is context dependent, this is going to have to use the context of the &lt;code&gt;load-xquery-module()&lt;/code&gt; function call, which isn't very meaningful, but I can't see what else to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative is to only include one function item in the result, corresponding to the maximum arity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we introduce sequence-variadic functions, the arity range becomes infinite, which makes both of these ideas problematic. But presumably sequence-variadic functions will be callable with all the values supplied in a single array?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
