   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix problem rendering xnt elements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close #428&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi @michaelhkay . I took a slightly different approach. For unknown reasons long since lost in the mists of time the 'etc' files that act as databases for cross-spec references stored &lt;code&gt;nt&lt;/code&gt; elements. That's weird because the &lt;code&gt;nt&lt;/code&gt; elements are supposed to point to &lt;code&gt;prod&lt;/code&gt; elements. I expect someone (let's be candid, probably me) got confused by the fact that &lt;code&gt;nt&lt;/code&gt; elements have a &lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt; attribute and thought they were definitions. They're not. I've changed things so that the &lt;code&gt;prod&lt;/code&gt; elements are now stored in the database. There's only going to ever be one of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to tidy up a few things to make that work, and we can't abandon support for &lt;code&gt;nt&lt;/code&gt; files in 'etc' documents because we have existing files that don't get regenerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also cleaned up the cross-reference error to &lt;code&gt;StringLiteral&lt;/code&gt; in the XSLT spec and patched over a problem with a few link in the XQuery specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no useful information from PR formatting of PRs that change the stylesheets, so I'm just going to cross my fingers and merge this. Please pull the latest and let me know if you see any problems!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
