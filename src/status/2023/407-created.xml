   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;XSLT-specific context properties used in function items&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just stumbled across the fact that current-group#0 doesn't work: see the note in 14.2.1 that says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other XSLT extensions to the dynamic evaluation context, the [current group] is not retained as part of the closure of a function value. This means that the expression current-group#0 is valid and returns a function value, but any invocation of this function will fail with a dynamic error [see [ERR XTDE1061].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This restriction is unnecessary and we should remove it. As people become more accustomed to using function items, they don't want to hit restrictions like this, and there's really no good implementation reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
