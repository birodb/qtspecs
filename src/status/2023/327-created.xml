   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokenisation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule in A.2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When tokenizing, the longest possible match that is consistent with the EBNF is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;needs clarifying. It could be read as suggesting that if taking the longest match turns out to lead to a syntax error, the tokenisation should be re-attempted using a shorter match. I don't think that has ever been intended. So what exactly does the qualifier "that is consistent with the EBNF" actually mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly related, A.2.2 Terminal Delimitation states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terminal symbols that are not used exclusively in [/* ws: explicit */] productions are of two kinds: delimiting and non-delimiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But (at least in the XQuery version) the list of delimiting tokens includes a number that are indeed used exclusively in ws:explicit productions, for example a number of tokens containing back-ticks, and &lt;code&gt;]]&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we need to be clearer that tokens used in ws:explicit productions are recognised only when parsing the production that uses them. For example given the expression &lt;code&gt;A[B[C]]&amp;gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, we should not recognise &lt;code&gt;]]&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as a token under the longest-token rule. I think that's probably what the "consistent with the EBNF" rule is intended to convey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
