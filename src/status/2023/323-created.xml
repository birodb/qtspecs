   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;add select attribute to xsl:text&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although xsl:text select="socks" would be the same as xsl:value-of select="socks" in implementation terms, users of XSLT 2 and later, even people who have been using XSLT 2 or 3 for some time, are often surprised to learn that xsl:value-of makes a text node, and that they need to use xsl:sequence to return something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it'd be great to have them use xsl:text instead of xsl:value-of, where text nodes are wanted, because then introducing xsl:sequence is a small step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, beginners also often use value-of where they should be using apply-templates, e.g. to handle mixed content! But again, using xsl:text reduces that temptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have value templates now, &lt;a href="xsl:text"&gt;xsl:text&lt;/a&gt;{ .... }&amp;lt;/xsl:text&amp;gt;, which mitigates the need slightly, but i think only slightly, because the select= analogy is very compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
