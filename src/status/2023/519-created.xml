   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;237: Revise tokenisation appendix&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This PR is an extensive revision to the rules for tokenisation that corrects a number of errors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem mentioned in issue 237, namely the lack of clarity in the "longest token rule". This PR fixes this by clarifying what this rule means and where it applies. In particular it tackles the issue of "complex terminals" such as element constructor expressions and string templates where a symbol that is a single token at one level (in the sense that whitespace is constrained) also contains enclosed expressions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some productions/tokens were misclassified or omitted from the relevant lists of tokens in the appendix. This has been fixed in part by using general rules in the grammar2spec stylesheet to generate lists of tokens, rather than relying on annotations in the grammar file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PR includes changes to the grammar2spec stylesheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
