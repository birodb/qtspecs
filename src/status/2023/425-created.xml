   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural proposal (ThinLayer:tm:) : Add a layer of thin spec between XPath and the XPath Derived Language&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;XPath is ubiquitous and is used even in places where we have no idea
On the other hand XPath is very useful to us as the centerpiece of XSLT, XQuery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to allow people to have a more expanded use of XPath without to have to get the whole XSLT, XQuery story, it is perhaps the time to consider adding a thin layer of spec in order to have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XPath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some typing definition mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some function definition mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is also to better integrate this with all Validation technologies (XSD, Relax NG, NVDL, JSONSchema, etc.) and allow EXPath, EXQuery and other to have a standard way to use all this around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also want people that want to use only XPath (for example in LinQ or inside SQL) to have a broader capacity to interact with XML (instead of being limited to XPath 1.0 with namespaces)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to add more and more precision to this proposal along the line, but I feel it is good enough to be a first stone to break and allow people to help drive this initiative&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the moment the name of this new beast is &lt;strong&gt;XPathWithCustomizableTypesAndFunctions&lt;/strong&gt; in our proposal call XPath Next https://github.com/XPath-Next/XPath-Next/blob/first-draft/spec.md&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
