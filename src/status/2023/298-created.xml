   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract supertype for map and array&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been wondering whether there would be any mileage in introducing an abstract super type for map() and array(), perhaps called lookup(). This would basically treat an array as a map with integer keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would allow a cleaner type signature for map:find() and any future functions such as xx:search() that work both on maps and arrays. It might simplify the description of the lookup operator "?". For functions that already exist in both the map and array namespaces, such as get(), we could introduce a unified function in the fn namespace with the cosmetic benefit of reducing the need for namespace prefixes and namespace declarations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still keen to find a better way of doing iteration, filtering, mapping, and construction of maps and arrays, and I think this might be a useful stepping stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
