   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remove legacy materials from the working master branch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;intended to be&lt;/em&gt; an entirely uninteresting change. This PR removes a whole bunch of historical artifacts from the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch, things like the requirements and use-cases documents that we aren't maintaining for QT4, the errata which don't apply to QT4, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will push a separate branch, &lt;code&gt;legacy-documentation&lt;/code&gt;, to the repository that contains all of the the files removed by this PR so that the aren't lost and can easily be recovered. (I won't do that as a PR, I'll just push it to the repository.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I think this trimmed down master branch works just fine and it's a lot simpler and easier to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This PR &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; remove support for the legacy ant builds, but I doubt they've worked for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
