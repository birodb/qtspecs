   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[XPath] URI validation function&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently there is no function to validate URI syntax against the relevant RFC. I expected that casting to &lt;code&gt;xs:anyURI&lt;/code&gt; validates but that seems not to be the case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it is impractical for processors to check that a value is a context-appropriate URI reference, this specification follows the lead of [RFC 2396] (as amended by [RFC 2732]) in this matter: such rules and restrictions are not part of type validity and are not checked by 路minimally conforming路 processors. Thus in practice the above definition imposes only very modest obligations on 路minimally conforming路 processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#anyURI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valid URIs are quite critical in strict RDF output formats such as RDF/XML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
