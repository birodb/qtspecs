   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[xslt30] Meaning of the term "lexical space"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The XSLT 3.0 specification uses the term "lexical space" rather freely, without definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In XSD, the "lexical space" for a data type is the set of lexical representations AFTER any whitespace removal. For example, the lexical space for xs:integer does not allow leading or trailing whitespace. Such whitespace is valid in an instance document, but it is stripped prior to validation by a "pre-lexical" transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In XSLT, as far as I can see, the intended reading of a phrase such as "a string in the lexical space of xs:integer" is "a string that is castable to xs:integer", which includes strings with leading and trailing whitespace. In some cases the text can only be read this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F&amp;amp;O spec gets this right. Section 19.2, relating to casting from xs:string, says "The supplied string is mapped to a typed value of the target type as defined in [XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition]. Whitespace normalization is applied as indicated by the whiteSpace facet for the datatype. The resulting whitespace-normalized string must be a valid lexical form for the datatype. The semantics of casting follow the rules of XML Schema validation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
