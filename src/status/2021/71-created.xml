   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[XSLT] Use of multiple predicates: order of evaluation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I notice I added an example pattern to the draft XSLT4 spec &lt;code&gt;match=".[. castable as xs:date][xs:date(.) le current-date()]"&lt;/code&gt; which is incorrect because processors are allowed to change the order of predicates, so you can't use the first predicate as a guard to stop the second predicate throwing an error. I've seen users fall over this (Saxon does sometimes reorder predicates). My instinct is to ban reordering of predicates; if you want to allow it, you can use the "and" operator. An alternative would be an "and" operator (say "and-also") with explicit ordering semantics, as in XPath 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
