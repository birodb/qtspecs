   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;New separators (apply-templates, for-each) vs attribute, value-of, serialization's item-separator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't know if the new separator attributes for apply-templates and for-each are designed to work differently than the existing separator functionality in XSLT 3. According to one of the examples, if the instruction produces sibling text nodes then separators are included between the text nodes. In XSLT 3, sibling text nodes are always merged and separators ignored. Perhaps this inconsistency should be reconsidered, or at least a note added for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
