   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[XSL] Support for "master files"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxygen allows to set one or more "master files" on a project. This is quite usefull when validating or searching for references while editing XSLT "modules" that depends on a main XSLT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main use-case is when I have an big XSLT that I want to split into modules (typically on module per mode). I could off course gather each global variable / parameters / function into the same module, but then I have to import it from each module if I want every XSLT to be valid. It would make more sens to import it once from the main XSLT, but then none of the other modules are valid anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to set master files would help in validation as a common XSLT feature. It would have no incidence on compilation but only as validation feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
