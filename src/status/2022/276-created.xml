   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make './gradlew publish' work on Windows #255&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix #255&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeat after me, "filenames are not URIs." Not on some platforms, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still get a warning about "correctness" because of the interaction between a couple of tasks. That doesn't happen on a *nix platform so I don't know if it's related to the difference between forward and backward slashes or if it's a consequence of the build changes I made to support the new SVG (that might be) in data model. They seem harmless for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
