   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merge signatures with optional params&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This addresses issue #291, concerned with the validity of function-catalog.xml against its XSD schema, and the validity of the intermediate file xpath-functions-40.xml against the xmlspec DTD (as amended for QT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also fixes the trivial error raised in issue #288, and addresses issue #70 by making each function have a single prototype with default values where appropriate. (This is not purely an editorial change, it enables you for example to supply () as the $length argument of fn:substring).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's more work on issue #257 (editorial improvements to handling of named record types).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This commit is mainly for technical review by NDW. It combines changes to the stylesheets, schema, and content, and may therefore require picking apart before it can be applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
