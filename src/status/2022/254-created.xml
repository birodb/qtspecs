   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improvements/fixes for the coercion rules&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This PR is concerned with the coercion rules (formerly known as function conversion rules).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It fixes issue #242, a minor omission where we failed to say that coercion rules are used to convert the result of a static function call to the required return type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It implements the proposal in issue #189, to apply the coercion rules to variable declarations/bindings as well as to function arguments and results. This brings XQuery into line with XSLT, and thus paves the way to allowing type declarations on "let" clauses in XPath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does some further editorial tidying up of the rules, such as improvng the definition of the term "coercion rules", adding clarifying notes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In approving this PR, I am requesting approval of the change (which was already in the draft, but has not been discussed) to introduce "down-casting" or "relabelling". This allows a function to declare a parameter with required type &lt;code&gt;xs:positiveInteger&lt;/code&gt;, and for a caller to supply the value 42 without explicitly casting it to &lt;code&gt;xs:positiveInteger&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
