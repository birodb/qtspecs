   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Record Tests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draft XPath specification includes a proposal for Record Tests - see section 3.6.4.3. This issue seeks WG endorsement of this enhancement, and also for the use of Record Tests as match patterns in XSLT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the feature is to provide more useful type checking for common use cases where maps are used to represent heterogeneous data. The feature enhances the type system but doesn't change the data model (that is, the new types represent a new way of placing constraints on the value space of maps, without introducing new kinds of values or new operations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type subsumption rules for record tests proposed in ยง3.7.2 clauses (m) et seq include a couple of TODO entries that need completing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
