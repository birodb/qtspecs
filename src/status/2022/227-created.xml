   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the Data Model specification; rename Serialization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added the Data Model specification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Renamed the Serialization specification from 3.1 to 4.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworked the way the cross reference index files (the /etc/ directory) are handled. The 4.0 versions are now generated every time, and should not be committed to the repository. (I haven't removed the old ones yet because this PR build will fail if I do. They're coming out next.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect that the old ant build scripts will no longer work. I'm probably going to pull all that infrastructure out Real Soon Nowâ„¢ as we've been working successfully with the new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
