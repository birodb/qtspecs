   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make higher-order-function support mandatory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think higher-order-functions are becoming a core part of XQuery and XSLT; we shouldn't encourage the mindset that they should be avoided because not all implementations will support them. I therefore propose dropping this as an optional feature; the relevant capabilities should become a core part of the language in 4.0, supported by all conformant implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
