   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;New proposed text resolving issue 71 (Guarded expressions)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discussion on issue 71 was very wide-ranging and went off into a number of tangents. This PR attempts to resolve the issue initially raised (order of evaluation of predicates) in a general way by introducing the notion of guarded expressions. This also provides a proposed solution to the question of "short-cutting" and/or expressions - essentially, an optimiser can change the order of evaluation, but doing so must not introduce dynamic errors that would not occur in a short-cutted evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
