   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type hierarchy tables/diagrams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 22 November, we mentioned in passing that the type hierarchy tables in the Data Model spec are hard to read. They're a garish yellow for no obvious reason and the font size is very small. Would replacing them with diagrams like this be an improvement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36793/203549753-a970038e-4b8b-44cb-97cb-8d52d2fc736f.png" alt="out"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is the largest and most difficult to represent, I think. I've grouped some of the atomic types together to make the drawing more aesthetically pleasing. I don't think that interferes with comprehension, though might need to be explained.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no particular rhyme or reason to the order of the items in the "second column" except to leave room for the longer hierarchies further to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
