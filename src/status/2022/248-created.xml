   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Editorial: update change logs and status&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This PR is purely editorial: it updates change logs and status information to reflect the current state of play. In particular, the change logs in appendices now attempt to distinguish changes approved by the WG from changes that were in the baseline draft prepared by the editor, but which have not yet been reviewed or approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
