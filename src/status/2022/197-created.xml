   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;NW for MK: Variadicity (166)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This PR is intended to be technically equivalent to #166.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've reworked a series of MK commits so that they are independent; I fear we would wind up with merge conflicts otherwise and cleaning up the merge conflicts, without accidentally making some other change, seemed riskier than just teasing them apart and making them independent before we accept and merge them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
