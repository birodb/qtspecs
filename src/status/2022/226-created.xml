   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the Data Model specification; rename Serialization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATTENTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; bunch of markup errors in the F&amp;amp;O specification. The build system has not been validating it before publication ðŸ˜ž ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜­ . I have fixed them in this PR. I fixed the markup where it was clear how to do that. I hacked at the DTDs to allow some new markup patterns. It's kind of a mess and if you've got an open PR on the F&amp;amp;O spec, I'm afraid it's going to be painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that horror show (hey, it's Halloween, maybe it's appropriate), I:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added the Data Model specification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Renamed the Serialization specification from 3.1 to 4.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworked the way the cross reference index files (the &lt;code&gt;/etc/&lt;/code&gt; directory) are handled. The 4.0 versions are now generated every time, and should not be committed to the repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect that the old ant build scripts will no longer work. I'm probably going to pull all that infrastructure out Real Soon Nowâ„¢ as we've been working successfully with the new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
