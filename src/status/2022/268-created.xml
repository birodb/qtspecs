   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;New type-hierarchy images / descriptions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close #265&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my attempt to improve the type-hierarchy images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; graphics already, but they were accidentally not being copied into the right place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But, they're for 3.1 and they're in some format I don't recognize, so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I created new SVG ones anyway, that folks may or may not like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I replaced the big, ugly yellow tables with prose. I concluded that accessibility was the only reason they were present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The colors are a little different, and a little "off", but they're explicitly chosen from a pallet that offers unambiguously differenty colors for the three most common forms of color-blindness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the SVG images is too wide, I'm not sure what to do about that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The labels are text, so you can search for them, and xs:anyAtomicType is a link. We could make more links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
