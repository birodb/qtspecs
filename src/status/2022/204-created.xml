   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-ascii alternative operator symbols&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appendix B.3 of the draft specification proposes that we provide non-ASCII synonyms for many of the operator symbols:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Operator | Symbol | Codepoint
-- | -- | --
and | ∧ | x2227
or | ∨ | x2228
eq | ≐ | x2250
ne | ≠ | x2260
lt | ⋖ | x22D6
gt | ⋗ | x22D7
le | ≤ | x2264
ge | ≥ | x2265
div | ÷ | xF7
mod |   |  
idiv | ⨸ | x2A38
union (\|) | ∪ | x222A
intersect | ∩ | x2229
except | ∖ | x2216
is | ≡ | x2261
&amp;lt;&amp;lt; (precedes) | ≪ | x226A
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (follows) | ≫ | x226B
otherwise | ⊩ | x22A9
some | ∃ | x2203
every | ∀ | x2200
satisfies | ⧴ | x29F4

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue is raised to enable discussion of this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to confess I'm going rather cool on the idea. Some of the proposed symbols are rather obscure, and they aren't always rendered very clearly on display; some can easily be confused with other symbols. It's going to take a lot of WG time to agree the details, and it will probably cause more usability problems than it solves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always felt that it was high time for programming to break loose from ASCII, but there are probably good reasons it hasn't done so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that we have two sets of comparison operators (and that some of the symbols clash with XML reserved characters) doesn't help. Providing alternative ways of writing them can only add to the confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to propose dropping this unless someone else wants to champion it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
