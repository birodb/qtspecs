   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For any new or existing function on sequences, also add its corresponding arrays' counterpart and vice versa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we have a proposal for a function &lt;code&gt;f1&lt;/code&gt; that has a sequence-argument, we need to also have (or propose if not-existent) a corresponding function &lt;code&gt;f2&lt;/code&gt; that has an array-argument in place of the &lt;code&gt;f1&lt;/code&gt;'s sequence argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;all($input as item()*, $predicate as function(item()) as xs:boolean)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the above function accepts a sequence as its 1st argument. In this case there is no existing function &lt;code&gt;all&lt;/code&gt; for arrays, therefore we will define/propose it together with the above function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;array:all($input as array(*), $predicate as function(item()*) as xs:boolean))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For consistency, clarity and to not confuse the reader of the Spec (for example trying to find why there is no corresponding 2nd function and abuse their imagination) we shall as a rule always provide a pair of such functions: one defined on sequence(s)  and one defined on array(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we were not going to propose a new function, but an "orphan" such function already exists, we will add its corresponding 2nd function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
