   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use external CSS for styling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This PR doesn't change anything technically, it moves around some big inline-blobs of CSS into external files so that we can have more consistency more easily. Every spec includes &lt;code&gt;qtspecs.css&lt;/code&gt; and another spec-specific CSS if it needs one. The diff markup is also in a separate CSS that's included in the diff versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I've broken the styling anywhere, but if you look around and find something that looks odd, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
