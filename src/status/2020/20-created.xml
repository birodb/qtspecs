   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlight EBNF grammar differences in the diff versions of the specs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diff versions of the specs highlight what has changed in the wording of the specifications, which is useful, but don't highlight the differences in the EBNF grammar. This makes it harder for implements and tool vendors to work out what has changed in the grammar to then know what changes need to be made to the lexer and parser in order to support the new constructs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
