:CUSTOM_ID: iss-414
:END:

+ See Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/414][#414]]. There was a lot of discussion of this issue last
  week. MK has followed-up with [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/414#issuecomment-1559849803][a comment]] that proposes a way forword.
  I propose a ten minute time-boxed discussion to answer the question:
  shall we direct someone to write a PR along the lines MK suggests?
